# react-contact-list

A simple react app pulling contacts from "https://randomuser.me" API and listing them in web broswer.

The list changes at each reload and the age can be toggled on and off based
on whether the user want's to view a specific contact's age or not.

This app is from a short tutorial on "https://freecodecamp.org".
